            <h2>FUN FACT_01</h2>
            <br />
            <p>It only takes 62 miles of traveling straight up to reach outer space. Going highway speeds in a rocketship could hypothetically there in about an hour.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box two">
            <h2>FUN FACT_02</h2>
            <br />
            <p>While space is considerably proximal, driving a car to the nearest star at highway speeds -- 70 mph -- would take more than 356 billion years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box three">
            <h2>FUN FACT_03</h2>
            <br />
            <p>Our Sun accounts for 99.86% of the total mass within our solar system. Given that math, all of the planets, asteriods, moons, and other matter account for the remaining 0.14%</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box four">
            <h2>FUN FACT_04</h2>
            <p>Gravity has an infinite range, with its strength weakening as distance increases, but never reaching zero. That means that, everything in the universe with any mass at all is pulling on you, right now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box five">
            <h2>FUN FACT_05</h2>
            <p>Massive objects curve space[time]. Time is planar, so the closer you are to a massive object, the more the curvature in the fabric. Because of this, time is actually warped. Think of a heavy ball on a flexible rubber sheet.</p>
