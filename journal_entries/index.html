                There are certain joys that come with making a website. It has been lost in the commercialization of sites and an emphasis on capitalizing off of the user. Web design should be made with intent, and it is even more important to disregard expectations. There are so many ways to approach it, but never will it be a finished product. A successful website is one that continues to evolve and has the ability to be reshaped.

                Many of our advancements today are overlooked. All things we use are a kind of technology with the same origins: being derived from basic elements. In some ways, HTML/CSS work in the same manner as they are the coding foundation. After reading Le Guin's text, I have a much broader appreciation for just about everything, and it's enjoyable to take a second in attempt to wrap my mind around such a concept.

                Websites today and online spaces have been stripped of their charm. The younger generations no longer have spaces to congregate and explore. There is no place to create fond memories that transform into nostalgic ones in years time. This factor triggers a sense of urgency as an artist because the web is littered with spaces that don't cater to the user's enjoyment -- rather the user's wallet and attention.
