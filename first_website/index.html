        <p>The primary goal of <a target="_blank" href="https://handmade-web.net/fall25/index.html">this class</a> is to <i>demystify and remove</i> the barrier for entry into web development and programming. Any and all questions are welcome. I won't know every answer, but we can <b>work together</b> to find one (and there are always many when it comes to coding). Learning how to search and read documentation are a coder’s <i><b>greatest tools</b></i>.

        So I'm just duplicating the same paragraph because I don't have many words within this paragraph so here: The primary goal of this class is to <em>demystify and remove</em> the barrier for entry into web development and programming. Any and all questions are welcome. I won't know every answer, but we can <strong>work together</strong> to find one (and there are always many when it comes to coding). Learning how to search and read documentation are a coder’s <em><strong>greatest tools</strong></em>.</p>

        <p class="banner">this is a list of things to do while learning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sit or stand</li>
            <li>think</li>
            <li>take notes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>this is the same list, but arbitrarily ordered:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>sit or stand</li>
            <li>think</li>
            <li>take notes</li>
        </ol>
